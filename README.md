This is a rewrite of the React [tic-tac-toe tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) in TypeScript. I'm also using Redux Toolkit because I wanted to practice with it. The `Board` component is containerized simply to pracitce creating a type for its props and because I prefer containers to passing down props when possible).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
